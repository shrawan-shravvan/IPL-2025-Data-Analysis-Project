#IPL 2025 Data Analysis using Excel

This project is a complete IPL 2025 data analysis done fully in Excel. It includes match-level and ball-level analysis, along with player-specific performance using the Orange Cap and Purple Cap datasets. The entire process was carried out step-by-step using pivot tables, charts, and dashboard techniques.

##Files Used

- matches.csv – Match-wise data like toss, scores, winners, etc.
- deliveries.csv – Ball-by-ball level data including runs, wickets, bowlers, etc.
- orange_cap.csv – Top 15 run-scorers of the season
- purple_cap.csv – Top 15 wicket-takers of the season

##What was done

###From matches.csv:
- Toss impact: Whether winning the toss helped in winning the match
- Player of the match analysis
- Match trends based on date and stage
- Team batting performance
- Match result summary

###From deliveries.csv:
- Dot ball count per bowler
- Total boundaries (4s and 6s) hit by batsmen
- Wickets taken by bowlers
- Powerplay analysis (overs 1 to 6)
- Death over analysis (overs 17 to 20)
- Team-wise boundary contributions

###From orange_cap.csv:
- Comparative analysis of top batsmen
- Strike rate vs average comparison
- Visuals for boundaries (4s and 6s)
- Consistency tracking (innings vs runs)

###From purple_cap.csv:
- Most impactful bowlers of the season
- Economy rate vs wickets taken
- Average and strike rate comparisons

##Visuals and Dashboards

All charts and pivot tables have been organized across separate sheets. Each key analysis has its own section. The dashboards are clean and visually explain the insights gathered from the data. A screenshot of one of the dashboards is also added as Dashboard.png.

###Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
  - Pivot Tables
  - Charts (Bar, Line, Radar)
  - Filters and Slicers
  - Basic Excel formulas for custom columns

##Purpose

This project was created as a portfolio piece to showcase Excel data analysis skills in a clean, well-structured way. It helps build a base before moving into advanced tools like Power BI, SQL, and Python. The goal was not just analysis, but presenting it in a simple, readable, and insightful way.

##What’s Next (future plan)

This project will later be extended using Power Bi. Python and SQL will also be used in the upcoming phases for more advanced querying, visual storytelling, and automation.
